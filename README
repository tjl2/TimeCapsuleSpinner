Apple's Time Capsule spins down the disk pretty quickly. If you store your iTunes library
on a Time Capsule, this often causes lag when unpausing music while the disk spins back
up again. This script checks to see if the Time Capsule shared disk is mounted and if
iTunes is running and just copies and rm's a file. Add this to cron to run every minute
and the Time Capsule will not spin down!

The script checks to see if the Time Capsule shared disk is currently mounted by checking
for the existence of a hidden file: /Volumes/Data/.mounted - so this needs to be created.

It also needs a file to copy. I use ~/TimeCapsuleSpinner.txt, which contains some text.
